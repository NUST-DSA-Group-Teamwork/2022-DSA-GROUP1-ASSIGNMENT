This folder has 3 files. The Main class java file, the doublyNode java file and the doublyLinkedList java file

The doublyNode file establishes 3 variables for the 3 parts of a node in a doubly linked list.
the variable song is for the data of a node, the next variable carries the address of the next node and the prev variable carries the address of the previous node.

The doublyLinkedList file is where all the functions (searchSong, insertSong,  removeSong and playSong) are created.

The Main class file is used to pass arguments into the parameters of these functions.
