This DSA GROUP 1  repository has 2 folders called SECTION A AND SECTION B.

Folder SECTION A contains the algorithm for the group project's SECTION A question.

Folder SECTION B contains the algorithm's implementation for the question in the group project's SECTION B. The programming language we used is Java.

We designed the algorithm for the playlist in Section A in the form of pseudocode. We used a doubly linked list for the playlist.

The algorithm was designed to be implemented in three class files.

-A class file to create the 3 parts of a doubly linked list: the node, the address for the previous node and the address for the next node.

-A class file to declare the head and tail, to create the doubly linked list playlist and to also create the functionalities via functions required for the playlist algorithm.

  The createDoublyLL() function is used to create the doubly linked list for the playlist
  
  The insertSong() function is used to add the songs from the array into the doubly linked list for the playlist.
  
  The playSong() function plays the songs by traversing through the doubly linked list.
  
  The searchSong () function is used to search for any song. If a song is not found, it will report that "Song does not exist.".
  
  The removeSong() function is used to remove a song from the playlist.

-A class file to call upon the functions: an insert, search, play and a remove function.

  The algorithm is designed to make use of arrays to contain the songs. using a for loop, the songs from the array, each, will be added into the doubly linked list playlist by calling upon the insert function.

The algorithm is then implemented in the java programming language using the application IntelliJ.

The repository also contains a file containing all members in the group.
